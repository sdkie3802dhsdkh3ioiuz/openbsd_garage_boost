Briefly writes 1 to a Raspberry Pi digital pin to simulate pressing button on garage wall console

In order to open a garage door, find the contacts on the back of your garage door wall console
that correspond to pushing the button. Solder a lead to each. Test them -- if you touch
the wires together very briefly, your garage door should open.

Now connect one lead to common on a relay (you can use a breadboard) and the other lead to
"normally open." Connect a jumper wire from the Raspberry Pi's GPIO 23 (I call it DOOR_PIN)
to one side of the relay's coil, and the 5v Raspberry Pi pin to the other side of the coil.
(If nothing works, switch which pin goes to which side of the coil.)

Running this program will energize the relay, which will connect COM (common) and NO 
(normally open). The garage wires will be connected, momentarily dropping the voltage to zero,
which will trigger the garage door to do its magic and open or close.
